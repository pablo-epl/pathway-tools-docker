#    Pathway Tools Init File
#    -----------------------
#    This file contains initialization parameters for Pathway Tools.
#    Each parameter needs to be specified on its own line, with the name
#    of the parameter followed by a separator consisting of one or more space characters,
#    which are followed by the value, which is usually a text string or an integer.
#
#    Lines beginning with the hash character "#" are ignored and are used for comments.
#    Therefore, when defining a value for a parameter whose line begins with "#",
#    please be sure to remove all hash characters from the line for that parameter
#    or it will remain inactive.
#
#    The parameters in this file can sometimes be overridden by supplying a
#    corresponding command-line flag to the pathway-tools startup script.

#
#    Parameters for Pathway Tools when running in WWW server mode
#      -- Setting these parameters is MANDATORY if you run Pathway Tools in
#         WWW server mode.

# Filename containing a valid SSL Certificate
#
###WWW-Server-SSL-Certificate NIL

# Hostname of the machine on which Pathway Tools is running
#
WWW-Server-Hostname localhost

# Port number on which Pathway Tools should listen for WWW server
# requests, and which Pathway Tools will insert in URLs within the
# WWW pages that it generates.  The standard port for WWW servers is 80,
# but this may require root privileges for starting up Pathway Tools.
#
WWW-Server-Port 1555

# The root directories of files (e.g., .html, .shtml, .js) served by
# the server. You can specify one directory or a list of directories
# separated by a '+' (no spaces). If a list, the directories will
# be searched in the order given when serving static files. Do not
# include a trailing slash or backslash at the end of the directories.
#
###WWW-Html-Root-Dir /home/user/PathwayTools/25/PathwayTools/aic-export/htdocs

# Set this to "Y" (no quotes) if you would like gzip to apply compression on
# CSS, HTML and JavaScript files served by the web server.
# This will generate gzip compressed files in the same
# directories as the original files, therefore enough
# disk space and write access must be provided for these
# directories to set this parameter to "Y".
# The PATH variable must also have a path to gzip for this to work.
# The default value for this parameter is "N".
# The value "Y" is applicable only to non Microsoft Windows systems.
#
###WWW-Use-Gzip N

# Set this to "N" (no quotes) to disable the use of SVG to draw compounds and reactions.
# SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a web standard for drawing figures.
# As of 16.0, Pathway Tools will use SVG on browsers that support it.
# This parameter can turn off SVG, in which case the older style of graphics
# will be used.
#
###WWW-Use-SVG Y

# Set this to "Y" (no quotes) to enable the web SmartTables feature.
# The default value for this parameter is "N".
# If web accounts database is set up, smarttables will be stored in the database
# otherwise they will be stored in ptools-local/groups. NOTE: the first time
# SmartTables are turned on with a database, the schema will be upgraded, so PLEASE
# make sure you make a backup first!
#
###WWW-Enable-Groups Y

# Set this to "all" (no quotes) or a list of organism IDs, separated
# by one or several '+' if several organism IDs, if you would like the
# title line for object pages to include the "Cyc" name of the database and not
# the organism name.
# If "all" is specified, it will apply to all databases. If a list of
# organism IDs is given, it will only apply to these organisms.
# The default value is "none".
#
###Use-Cyc-Name none

################################################################################
#
#    Additional Parameters for Pathway Tools when running in WWW server mode
#      -- Setting these parameters is OPTIONAL if you run Pathway Tools in
#         WWW server mode.

# The email address to which users of your Web site should send technical-support
# email messages.  This address will be inserted into pages generated on your Web site.
# Please check to see whether test emails are being sent.  If not, check
# whether the executable /usr/lib/sendmail exists on the server machine, and whether
# it is set up correctly to send messages.
#
###Support-Email-Address biocyc-support@ai.sri.com

# The name used for the Web site being operated by Pathway Tools.
# This name will be inserted by Pathway Tools into pages that it generates
# on your Web site.
#
###WWW-Site-Name BioCyc

# Specify which organisms should be published by the WWW server.
# Users may publish all PGDBs on a site by using "all",
# or a list of organism IDs delimited by +'s.
# Example of the latter: ECOLI+META+VCHO
#
###WWW-Publish all

# Needed only for a Proxy WWW Server setup.
# Port number on which another WWW server, such as Apache, will listen
# for requests to forward them to the Pathway Tools WWW server.
# When using this parameter, the other WWW server needs to be configured
# to actually forward the requests.
#
###WWW-Server-Proxy-Port 80

# If a WWW-Server-Port smaller than 1024 is specified, on UNIX, the root user
# needs to start the Pathway Tools, and after the WWW server starts listening,
# it will switch to the user account indicated here, to reduce security risks.
#
###WWW-Server-User biocyc

# Number of seconds after which Web pages expire, which were cached by the browser.
# Setting this to a large value (like several days) should improve responsiveness for users,
# because the static Web pages do not need to be reloaded from the Pathway Tools server.
# Dynamically generated pages will however usually ignore this parameter.
#
###WWW-Browser-Static-Page-Expiry-Seconds 604800

# If WWW-Quick-Search-Textfield-Label is set to a given string, then that string
# will appear to the left of the Quick Search text box at the bottom of every
# database page. The default is to have it say, "Quick Search".
# To enter spaces into the string, use the underscore key: "Quick_Search".
#
###WWW-Quick-Search-Textfield-Label Quick_Search

# Set to "Y" to have the Query Page display the "Summary page for dataset"
# link. A value of "N" suppresses it.
#
###WWW-Show-Organism-Summary-Link Y

# Set to "Y" to have the Query Page display the "History of updates for this
# dataset" link. A value of "N" suppresses it.
#
###WWW-Show-Update-History-Link Y

# Set to "Y" to have the Query Page display the "Cellular Overview Diagram /
# Omics Viewer" link. A value of "N" suppresses it.
#
###WWW-Show-Diagram/Omics-Viewer-Links Y

# Change the limit of the number of organism databases that can be /
# simultaneously chosen for comparative analyses.  A larger value will
# increase the time to return results, and will make the resulting Web pages
# more cumbersome to examine.
#
###WWW-Max-Multiorg-Choice 70

# Set to "Y" to have pathway displays include predicted enzymes by default.
# A value of "N" means that only enzymes with experimental evidence will
# appear unless the user requests to see all enzymes.
# If the default should be different for different PGDBs, use this parameter in
# conjunction with the WWW-Default-Predicted-Enzymes-Exceptions-PGDBs parameter.
#
###WWW-Default-Show-Predicted-Enzymes Y

# Specify which PGDBs should have the opposite default predicted enzyme
# behavior to that specified by the WWW-Default-Show-Predicted-Enzymes
# parameter.  Supply a list of organism IDs delimited by +'s.
# Example: ECOLI+META+VCHO
#
###WWW-Default-Predicted-Enzymes-Exceptions-PGDBs

# Set to "Y" to have the IP addresses translated to DNS names for web
# requests. A value of "N" disables it.
#
###WWW-Enable-DNS-Lookups Y

# Set to "Y" to enable use of domain cookies for session cookies.
# A value of "N" disables it.
#
###WWW-Enable-Domain-Cookies N

# Max upload size in bytes for Omics Data
#
###WWW-Omics-Max-Upload-Size 1000000

# Path to directory where PGDBs created using web-pathologic should be written.  If this is not set, web-pathologic is disabled.
#
###WWW-Pathologic-Destination-Dir
